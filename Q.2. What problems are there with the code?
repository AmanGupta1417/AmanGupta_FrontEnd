There are several issues with the code:
1.	The setSelectedIndex state is not being initialized with any value.
2.	The isSelected prop of SingleListItem is being passed the selectedIndex state instead of a boolean value.
3.	The items prop type definition is incorrect. It should be PropTypes.arrayOf(PropTypes.shape({ ... })) instead of PropTypes.array(PropTypes.shapeOf({ ... })).
4.	The onClickHandler prop of SingleListItem is not being passed the index value correctly. It should be wrapped in an arrow function to avoid being called immediately.
5.	The useEffect hook in WrappedListComponent is causing an infinite loop. It should be wrapped in a conditional statement to avoid running on every render.
